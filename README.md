# personal-portfolio
This is a personal portfolio website inspired by Sharlene Yap’s desktop-style design. It’s built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring an interactive “desktop” experience with draggable windows, a custom cursor, animated backgrounds, floating particles, and a taskbar.
