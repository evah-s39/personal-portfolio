## What this project is
This is my personal portfolio website, inspired by Sharlene Yap’s desktop-style design. It’s a fully interactive site built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, showcasing who I am, my skills, experience, achievements, and ways to connect with me. The design uses a desktop-like interface with draggable windows, a custom cursor, animated background effects, and hover interactions to make the experience more engaging.  

## Why I made this project
I wanted a personal space to display my work, achievements, and interests in a way that’s interactive, clean, and visually appealing. It’s also a way to challenge myself to implement animations, draggable UI, and custom effects in JavaScript, while keeping a minimalist and professional aesthetic.  

## How I made this project
- **HTML:** Structured the windows, taskbar, hero section, and content areas.  
- **CSS:** Styled the site with gradients, glassmorphism, animations, responsive design, and hover effects.  
- **JavaScript:** Added interactivity, including:
  - Draggable windows
  - Custom cursor and cursor follower
  - Animated floating particles
  - Typing animation in the "About Me" terminal
  - Keyboard shortcuts for quick navigation
  - Click ripple effects and parallax hero background  

## Challenges & Learnings
- Learning how to implement **draggable windows** that work smoothly on all screen sizes.  
- Making animations and effects **performant** without slowing down the page.  
- Balancing interactivity and design while keeping the site **user-friendly**.  
- Gained deeper understanding of **DOM manipulation, CSS animations, and responsive design** in real-world projects.
